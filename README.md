# Shooping Cart project.

🛒 React Shopping Cart – useContext API Practice

## Project Overview

This project is a simple shopping cart application built with React.
The primary goal of this project is to deeply understand and implement the React Context API (useContext) for global state management.

Instead of passing props through multiple component levels (prop drilling), this application uses Context to manage and share cart state across the entire app.

## Learning Objectives

-Understand the purpose of the React Context API

-Eliminate prop drilling using useContext

-Manage global cart state efficiently

-Structure scalable state logic in a React application

-Improve component architecture and separation of concerns
